\section{Results}
\label{sec:org28f7420}
So far, in sections \ref{sec:Analysis_method1} and \ref{sec:Analysis_method2}, we have studied how does a multivariate and a singlevariate calssifcation technique respond to energy scale uncertainties, in a signal from background sepparation task. In this chapter, we are going to summarize the results and provide commentary regarding each method, in terms of performance and robustness. Moreover will will draw a comparizon between the two methods.
