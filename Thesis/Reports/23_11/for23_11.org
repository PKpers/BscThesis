* PtEtaPhi set
- Optimized the training

** Feature importance

The most important feature is Pt as expected. Eta plays a rather minor role in the classification. Phi is not needed. Obviously, only the coordinates of one particle are needed 
** Relationship between Pt and eta

* PxPyPz
The only difference is the coordinate system. All the other settings are the same as before
Training was done with the optimized configuration

Size: 250K events for signal and 250K events for background

** Results
One would expect that the performance would drop since the in the Px Py Pz coordinate system, there is no variable that could potentially  "give off" the discriminative features
** Feature importance  
[[/home/kpapad/UG_thesis/Thesis/Bdt/out/Plots/S10B13_restPxyz500kConf1BDTplot_FeatureImportance.jpg]]
Indeed all features play a role on the classification.

 There is better performance now!
 Why?
** Mabe we are using too much data
Let's do it again with less data lets have 50k events for signal and 50k for background
** Training less data
[[/home/kpapad/UG_thesis/Thesis/Bdt/out/Plots/S10B13_restPxyz50kConf1BDTplot.jpg]]
The training size seems to have no impact in the performance
...or a sample size of 50K evetns for signal and 50k for background is sufficient to have performance near 100% ! 
** Training with less data and a different configuration
Lets use a configuration that was suboptimal, in the case of PtEtaPhi coordinates
[[/home/kpapad/UG_thesis/Thesis/Bdt/out/Plots/S10B13_restPxyz50kConf10BDTplot.jpg]]
The performance drops, but its still on the high end.
